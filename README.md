REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](http://www.yiiframework.com/download/) to
a directory named `basic` that is directly under the Web root.

Set cookie validation key in `config/web.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
```

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.1.1"
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `basic` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~

### Getting Started

Use to install kartik/fileInput:

~~~
composer require kartik-v/yii2-widget-fileinput "@dev"
~~~

Use following command to install TinyMce text editor:

~~~
composer require "2amigos/yii2-tinymce-widget" "*" or add "2amigos/yii2-tinymce-widget" : "*"
~~~

The usage is pretty simple and doesn't differ much from other similar widgets:

```php
use dosamigos\tinymce\TinyMce;

<?= $form->field($model, 'text')->widget(TinyMce::className(), [
    'options' => ['rows' => 6],
    'language' => 'es',
    'clientOptions' => [
        'plugins' => [
            "advlist autolink lists link charmap print preview anchor",
            "searchreplace visualblocks code fullscreen",
            "insertdatetime media table contextmenu paste"
        ],
        'toolbar' => "undo redo | styleselect | bold italic | alignleft aligncenter alignright alignjustify | bullist numlist outdent indent | link image"
    ]
]);?>
```

Before you can go on you need to use following command, which allows you to create table for storing users data:

~~~
yii migrate
~~~

After that you should prepare some tables for DbManager to store its data. Use following command:

~~~
yii migrate --migrationPath=@yii/rbac/migrations
~~~

To build authorization data you should use this command:

~~~
yii rbac/init
~~~

This command allows you to associate rules with roles and permissions.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```
If you don't want to change data in `config/db.php` to access your own local database, you can
use your configurations file, just create `config/db-local.php` and edit the file, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```
If you create `config/db-local.php`, this file will be used instead of `config/db.php`automatically.

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- Refer to the README in the `tests` directory for information specific to basic application tests.
